Hi. I'm parsa. I'm 21 yo and I live in Karaj. I study Computer Engineering at Sharif Univrsity of Technology. As it's obvious I want to become a computer engineer in the future.
My hobbies are playing video games and listening to music. If I find some time, I would watch movies and tv series too.
I am currently a Java Developer at Behsa Company. The payment is satisfying so I've got stuck to it.
I'm happy that I'm learning android programming too and I'll try mu best to become a great android developer one day.I hope to learn this as well as I learned Java.
